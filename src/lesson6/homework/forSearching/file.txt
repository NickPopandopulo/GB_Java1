This notice is to inform users that the SOFA Board is issuing a Minor Release (17a) to both the Fortran and ANSI C
versions of Release 17 of the SOFA software library on 2021 February 24 at 12:00 UTC. The change relates to dealing
with leap seconds during the period 1960 and 1971. Between the introduction of UTC at the start of 1960 and the first
leap second at the end of 1971 there were a series of small offsets and rate changes with respect to TAI. The SOFA
routine D2DTF takes these into account, but a shortcoming in the algorithm meant that under certain conditions a leap
second could be flagged even though none had occurred. Such cases were extremely rare, and moreover depended to some
extent on compiler behaviour, affecting rounding.
